| 2016-10-27 | Restructured the book to provide a more clear separation between app-specific and server-side functionality.Updated the book to reflect the use of the User Notifications framework. |
| 2016-09-20 | Added guidance, primarily in the [APNs Overview](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/APNSOverview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008194-CH8-SW1) chapter, on using a provider authentication token for APNs.Corrected [Figure 6-5](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/APNSOverview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008194-CH8-SW2).Updated [Figure 6-3](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/APNSOverview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008194-CH8-SW3) to illustrate using a provider authentication token.Added a note in the [APNs Overview](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/APNSOverview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008194-CH8-SW1) chapter that in iOS 10 and later you should implement local notifications with the User Notifications framework and the User Notifications UI framework.Added a note about the requirement for a GeoTrust Global CA root certificate for providers, in [Provider-to-APNs Connection Trust](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/APNSOverview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008194-CH8-SW4).Updated and expanded [HTTP/2 Response from APNs](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/CommunicatingwithAPNs.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008194-CH11-SW2).Clarified [Quality of Service, Store-and-Forward, and Coalesced Notifications](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/APNSOverview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008194-CH8-SW5). |
| 2016-03-21 | Minor clarifications and corrections throughout document.Removed information about the content-length property from the [Communicating with APNs](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/CommunicatingwithAPNs.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008194-CH11-SW1) chapter. This property is not relevant to the APNs provider API because of two factors. 1. An APNs payload always fits inside a single DATA frame. 2. The length of a DATA frame is declared in the frame header, according to the HTTP/2 specification. Eliminating the content-length property reduces bandwidth, complexity, and processing time for APNs requests. |
