Audience targeting helps you show your ads to the people you care about. There are two general approaches — specific or broad — you can take when creating a target audience. The approach you choose depends on what you're trying to accomplish and your available resources.

受众目标可以帮助您将您的广告展示给您关注的人群。在创建目标受众时，你可以采取两种通用方法——指定或广播。您选择的方法取决于您试图实现的目标和可用资源。

You can be specific and create audiences based on customer data, conversion data such as activity in your app or website, etc. Or, you can provide broader information, such as demographics or location, and we deliver ads to people who meet those attributes.

您可以根据客户数据、转化数据（如应用程序或网站中的活动等）创建特定受众。或者，您可以提供更广泛的信息，如人口统计或位置，我们会向符合这些属性的人投放广告。
